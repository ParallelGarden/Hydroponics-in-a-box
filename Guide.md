# STEP BY STEP GUIDE

## INTRODUCTION

This hydroponic system was developed as a custom design feature for Bitcoin Coffee in Parallel Polis. It is meant to supply the Cafe with specific vegetables that are being used there (mostly leaf vegetables). It also serves for experiments that are combining growing in hydroponic system, IoT technologies, and open source in order to reach as much autonomity of the system as possible that is able to optimize growing process, and energy consumption to the most reasonable effectivity.
